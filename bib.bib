schemes as well as publications and other research activities. By supporting linkages across multiple datasets &#8211; clinical trials, publications, patents, datasets &#8211; such a registry becomes a switchboard for researchers and publishers alike in managing the dissemination of research
findings. We describe use cases for embedding ORCID identifiers in manuscript submission workflows, prior work searches, manuscript citations, and repository deposition. We make recommendations for storing and displaying ORCID identifiers in publication metadata to include ORCID identifiers,
with CrossRef integration as a specific example. Finally, we provide an overview of ORCID membership and integration tools and resources.",

@inproceedings {kdd,
abstract     = {<p>KDD Cup 2013 challenged participants to tackle the problem of author name
                ambiguity in a digital library of scientific publications. The competition
                consisted of two tracks, which were based on large-scale datasets from a snapshot
                of Microsoft Academic Search, taken in January 2013 and including 250K authors
                and 2.5M papers. Participants were asked to determine which papers in an author
                profile are truly written by a given author (track 1), as well as to identify
                duplicate author profiles (track 2). Track 1 and track 2 were launched
                respectively on April 18 and April 20, 2013, with a common final submission
                deadline on June 12, 2013. For track 1 a training dataset with correct labels was
                diclosed at the start of the competition. This track was the most popular one,
                attracting submissions of 561 different teams. Track 2, which was formulated as
                an unsupervised learning task, received submissions from 241 participants. This
                paper presents details about the problem definitions, the datasets, the
                evaluation metrics and the results.</p>},

title="Author disambiguation using multi-aspect similarity indicators",
journal="Scientometrics",
year="2011",
volume="91",
number="2",
pages="435--449",
abstract="Key to accurate bibliometric analyses is the ability to correctly link individuals to their corpus of work, with an optimal balance between precision and recall. We have developed an algorithm that does this disambiguation task with a very high recall and precision. The method addresses the issues of discarded records due to null data fields and their resultant effect on recall, precision and F-measure results. We have implemented a dynamic approach to similarity calculations based on all available data fields. We have also included differences in author contribution and age difference between publications, both of which have meaningful effects on overall similarity measurements, resulting in significantly higher recall and precision of returned records. The results are presented from a test dataset of heterogeneous catalysis publications. Results demonstrate significantly high average F-measure scores and substantial improvements on previous and stand-alone techniques.",

It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.",

title="A comparison of extrinsic clustering evaluation metrics based on formal constraints",
journal="Information Retrieval",
year="2009",
volume="12",
number="4",
pages="461--486",
abstract="There is a wide set of evaluation metrics available to compare the quality of text clustering algorithms. In this article, we define a few intuitive formal constraints on such metrics which shed light on which aspects of the quality of a clustering are captured by different metric families. These formal constraints are validated in an experiment involving human assessments, and compared with other constraints proposed in the literature. Our analysis of a wide range of metrics shows that only BCubed satisfies all formal constraints. We also extend the analysis to the problem of overlapping clustering, where items can simultaneously belong to more than one cluster. As Bcubed cannot be directly applied to this task, we propose a modified version of Bcubed that avoids the problems found with other metrics.",

Because these new micro-array devices generate bewildering amounts of raw data, new analytical methods must be developed to sort out whether cancer tissues have distinctive signatures of gene expression over normal tissues or other types of cancer tissues.",
